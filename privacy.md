# BlacKTimE ðŸŽ¶ - Privacy Policy
Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains what limited data the BlacKTimE bot may collect, how itâ€™s used to enhance your experience, and how we protect your information. By using Pityusha, you agree to the practices outlined below.

### 1. What Data We Collect
- Temporary Session Data: BlacKTimE processes command and playback data within a session (e.g., current song requests) to operate the botâ€™s core features. This data is not retained once the session ends.

- Minimal Retained Data: For a better user experience, BlacKTimE may store limited non-personal data, such as song history or playlists, to improve functionality (e.g., recalling previously played songs). No personally identifiable information (PII) is collected or stored at any time.

### 2. Use of Data
- Enhanced User Experience: Any limited data collected (e.g., song history) is used solely to enhance music playback features and to make your interactions more seamless and enjoyable. This data is never used for purposes outside Pityushaâ€™s core functionality.

- No Third-Party Sharing: BlacKTimE does not share, sell, or transmit any user information to third parties.

### 3. Your Privacy Rights
- Data Minimization and Control: We collect only the data essential to BlacKTimEâ€™s functionality. No identifiable information is logged or used for tracking purposes. You may request the deletion of any retained data, such as song history, by contacting the bot administrator (see below).

### 4. Changes to This Policy
- We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in our practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. Updates will be posted in this document, and continued use of the bot signifies acceptance of the updated policy.

### 5. Contact
- If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or wish to request data deletion, please contact the bot administrator directly at kasai.exe.
